## General Information
- A US-based housing company named Surprise Housing has decided to enter the Australian market. The company uses data analytics to purchase houses at a price below their actual values and flip them on at a higher price. For the same purpose, the company has collected a data set from the sale of houses in Australia.

The company is looking at prospective properties to buy to enter the market. We are required to build a regression model using regularisation in order to predict the actual value of the prospective properties and decide whether to invest in them or not.

<!-- You don't have to answer all the questions - just the ones relevant to your project. -->

## Conclusions
-  Best model is ridge regression with alpha = 0.03 having subset features 4 as input. It is also noted that the accuracy can further be improved by further reducing the features with cross validation and advance feature selection techniques
